indu:
1. Design basic filters via Matlab
2. Use filtering to generate speech shaped noise and extract signal envelope
3. Adjust the signal intensity adjusting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level normalizing signal energy
exp:
1.Learn to design and use different fiter, also find their difference.
2.Learn to use filter analyaze wav file and 
3.Try to adjust SNR in the signal.
